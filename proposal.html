<h2 class="c18" id="h.9zswkq25txsl"><span class="c10">Setting 1: A large virtual lecture</span></h2>
<p class="c5"><span class="c30"></span></p>
<p class="c9"><span class="c2">A typical virtual 200 level engineering class with around 250 students. Most participants are young adults in their late 10s or early 20s, although there are some exceptions of older students.</span></p>
<p class="c5"><span class="c2"></span></p>
<p class="c9"><span>While the professor is presenting a basic circuit schematic, a student is interrupted by her mother. She briefly leaves her desk and walks to the living room to see what&rsquo;s going on. After a short while she returns and finds that the professor is now asking everyone to do an exercise. She has no idea what just happened and wants to ask her friend what she missed, so she picks up her phone and texts him. He replies after a while, but the professor is already moving on to discussing the answer.</span></p>
<p class="c5"><span class="c2"></span></p>
<p class="c9"><span class="c2">This observation leads to our first persona, Julia. </span></p>
<p class="c5"><span class="c30"></span></p>
<h2 class="c18" id="h.j2m0pyyfuyra"><span class="c10">Setting 2: Joining a talk by industry leaders with colleagues</span></h2>
<p class="c5"><span class="c2"></span></p>
<p class="c9"><span class="c2">A virtual design talk given by a senior designer at Google as part of a 2-day worldwide design conference. Most people joining are designers whose companies were given tickets.</span></p>
<p class="c5"><span class="c2"></span></p>
<p class="c9"><span class="c2">The host is presenting a novel method of incorporating data into design decisions. An attendee thinks that it&rsquo;s a great idea and wants to quickly tell his colleagues that they should try it out next time at work. Since there is no option to &lsquo;chat privately&rsquo; in the meeting software they are using, the attendee decides to message his colleagues on Slack. His colleagues who are online on Slack quickly reply with &lsquo;Yes!&rsquo; and &lsquo;It&rsquo;s so cool!&rsquo;.</span></p>
<p class="c5"><span class="c2"></span></p>
<p class="c9"><span>Colleagues who weren&rsquo;t on Slack during the conference saw a string of messages the next morning. They don&rsquo;t recall what the host was saying about the method so they have to ask around.</span></p>
<p class="c5"><span class="c2"></span></p>
<p class="c9"><span class="c2">This observation leads to our second persona, Andrew.</span></p>
<p class="c5"><span class="c2"></span></p>
<h2 class="c18" id="h.h959ry7ljjyx"><span class="c10">Setting 3: Cross team meeting before product launch</span></h2>
<p class="c9"><span class="c2">It is 3 days before the scheduled product launch and the employees of Umbrella Corporation are having a cross-team meeting. The meeting consists of 30+ people with project managers, the development team, the testing team, the design team, and the customer relation team involved. </span></p>
<p class="c5"><span class="c2"></span></p>
<p class="c9"><span class="c2">While they are discussing action items for this launch, one of the project managers wants to explain to the development team lead a task he has been assigned to. She doesn&rsquo;t want to disrupt the meeting so she tries messaging the team lead through the private messaging function on the video conferencing software, but it seems like he doesn&rsquo;t have the chat window opened. She resorts to Slack messaging him, where she gets an immediate response. Although she is usually good at multitasking, the fact that she has to figure out a way to get an instant reply from the team lead causes her to lose focus for a moment, and she misses part of the meeting. </span></p>
<p class="c5"><span class="c2"></span></p>
<h1 class="c3" id="h.11xlblpijrr6"><span>Problem</span></h1>
<p class="c9"><span>From our observations, it is clear that</span><span class="c2">&nbsp;current video conferencing solutions do not aptly recreate/facilitate the adhoc/sidebar interactions that humans routinely have in large meetings, such as classroom and professional meeting environments (aka whispering little thoughts or comments to peers). We believe these types of &#39;sidebar conversations&#39; are an essential part of group meetings and collaborative effort.</span></p>
<p class="c5"><span class="c2"></span></p>
<p class="c9"><span class="c2">This shortcoming of modern video-conferencing software is often worked-around by people needing to have a chat application open in parallel and directly messaging other attendees during the meeting. In physical settings, these little/adhoc chats back and forth would simply involve leaning over to your neighbour and whispering something in their ear but this is a cumbersome task in current systems.</span></p>

<p class="c5"><span class="c2"></span></p>
<p class="c9"><span class="c2">Julia is friendly and studious. She currently lives at home with her parents, her brother, and a dog. Since school went online, she has been studying mainly from her room, although she would sometimes work in the living room as well. </span></p>
<p class="c5"><span class="c2"></span></p>
<p class="c9"><span class="c2">Although she has a fairly good relationship with her family, she still finds it a bit distracting when everyone&rsquo;s working from home. Her mum and her brother would sometimes bother her in the middle of the lecture, causing her to lose focus. In a recent class, she was interrupted by her mum yelling in the living room. After returning to her seat, she found out that she has now lost track of what was happening. She texted her friend, but he didn&rsquo;t reply instantly and she ended up missing this part of the lecture. When asked about her experience, she replied</span></p>

<p class="c9"><span class="c19">Occupation:</span><span class="c2">&nbsp;Senior Product Designer at Cool.co</span></p>
<p class="c5"><span class="c2"></span></p>
<p class="c9"><span class="c2">Andrew describes himself as sociable and curious. He likes to attend design conferences and applies what he learned to his job. Before the pandemic, he would go to the venue with his colleagues and sit together. If he was attending alone, he would not be shy to strike up small talks with strangers around him.</span></p>
<p class="c5"><span class="c2"></span></p>
<p class="c9"><span class="c2">Now that everything is virtual, he is finding the lack of quick and immediate exchange of feedback frustrating. In a recent conference, Andrew wanted to quickly discuss something related to the presentation with his colleagues but he couldn&rsquo;t lean over and whisper as he would&rsquo;ve in real life. As a workaround, he went on Slack and messaged his team there, but some of his colleagues weren&rsquo;t active on Slack at that time. The next day, he got some questions on what his message was referring to. As a result, he had to spend extra time explaining to his colleagues. When asked about this problem he sadi</span></p>

<p class="c9"><span class="c19">Occupation:</span><span class="c2">&nbsp;Executive Project Management</span></p>
<p class="c5"><span class="c2"></span></p>
<p class="c9"><span class="c2">Sharon has more than a million things on the go, never misses a beat and definitely doesn&rsquo;t have time for your small talk. In order to manage her many parallel streams of work, Sharon is a master multi-tasker often juggling emails, incoming requests, knocking at her office door and coordinating picking up her kids after school all the while attending back to back meetings!</span></p>
<p class="c5"><span class="c2"></span></p>
<p class="c9"><span>One of Sharon&rsquo;s mechanisms for flawlessly keeping all her projects moving and on budget is to act and adapt fast. Any time clients or board members mention a deadline or need something done their words have barely left their mouth before Sharon has delegated it to her team and picks the best person for the job. In meet rooms everyone would know the subtle communications or glances she would make letting you know </span><span>she needed this from you and you had better not let her down</span><span class="c2">. On the many video-meetings she has had to resort to popping open a parallel messaging app to delegate in real-time like she is so famous for. Obviously typing up messages in separate apps isn&rsquo;t as fluid but Sharon and her team are adapting as best they can..</span></p>
<p class="c5"><span class="c2"></span></p>
<p class="c9"><span class="c8">&ldquo;It&#39;s just so hard to operate and orchestrate my team as quickly now that everything is on video-conferencing.&rdquo;</span></p>

<p class="c9"><span class="c2">In eZuce&rsquo;s Viewme, the user can select a person he wants to whisper to from the dropdown menu and he will be directed to a separate room if the person accepts the whispering request. In this separate room, users can talk freely without others in the meeting hearing them. It&rsquo;s also possible to have multiple private rooms simultaneously, although the user can only be active in one room at a time. </span></p>

<p class="c9"><span>We are still exploring options, but our proposed solution might be able to cover all of the 4 points mentioned above. </span><span>With the spatial aspect included in our design, users will be able to virtually &lsquo;sit&rsquo; next to people they know, and initiate whispers to them. The volume of the whisper and the voice of the main speaker will vary according to where they are sitting virtually. </span><span class="c2">With this feature, we will be able to replicate an experience similar to real life scenarios and improve the overall video conferencing quality. </span></p>
<p class="c5"><span class="c2"></span></p>
<p class="c9"><span>We will also be able to mitigate the downfall of whispering in real life, such as losing focus and missing out on the presentation, hearing unwanted whispering around you and getting annoyingly disrupted by a talkative neighbour. With a </span><span>playback function, users can choose to replay sections of the recorded presentation that they missed as they were whispering. </span><span class="c2">Whispers will be confined to involved personnel only so other users sitting next to them virtually will not be disrupted. Users will be able to block unwanted whispers as well.</span></p>

<h2 class="c18" id="h.bfehj9b3geqj"><span class="c10">Standard Video Conferencing Application : </span></h2>
<p class="c9 c29"><span class="c2">This web application will be written in JavaScript (unsurprisingly) and HTML/CSS and is designed to run inside the browser. Conceptually, all users (including the presenter) will access the video-conference room by entering a unique key for their meeting. Similar to how many video-conferencing systems work by using a share link and a unique &lsquo;meeting ID&rsquo;. In the below diagram we see a standard video-conference session where arrows connecting the speaker and all listeners represent the flow of audio from the presenter to many recipients while all recipients are on mute. In our scenario however, a couple of the peers have engaged in a &lsquo;whisper&rsquo; or sidebar conversation; these ephemeral whispers are denoted by a dashed line in the diagram between peers.</span></p>

<h2 class="c18" id="h.4j2qbjm13yp"><span class="c10">Whisper Specific Functionality :</span></h2>
<p class="c9 c29"><span class="c2">The below diagram more clearly defines the steps involved with establishing a whisper between participants. Once everyone is in the video-conference (likely most will be on mute) and the presenter has started their seminar, then someone decides to initiate a whisper with another participant in the meeting by clicking on their video/icon. This action initiates a peer-to-peer connection (facilitated by the &lsquo;signaling server&rsquo; likely Google&rsquo;s) between the two participants. Steps 1&amp;2 represent the connection &amp; permission information passed between peers to establish the audio/video connection denoted by 3. These audio/video &lsquo;whisper&rsquo; connections use the exact same technologies and APIs that the standard video conferencing is using (WebRTC) but the mic input from initiator is directed directly to the receiver rather than the larger audience allowing for sidebar conversations without disrupting the entire session. On the periphery we have the application database which simply acts as a shared datasource for maintaining user &amp; session information, meeting rooms and facilitates request passing between participants.</span></p>

<h1 class="c3" id="h.g80zre4eshnq"><span class="c22">Feasibility</span></h1>
<p class="c5"><span class="c2"></span></p>
<p class="c9"><span class="c2">There are 2 main components to the technical implementation of our system. Firstly, identifying and adapting existing standard web-based video-conferencing solutions to fit our needs. There are many of these sample applications that are pre-built and open-sourced, most of which use the relatively simple WebRTC javascript API. Once we&rsquo;ve familiarized and adapted this video-conferencing app, we will build on top the &lsquo;whisper&rsquo; functionality. Establishing the actual connection between peers will be trivial by reusing the functions/capability from the sample application. Theorizing, designing and then implementing the user-experience around initiating and engaging seamlessly with whispers will be the focus of our effort.</span></p>
<p class="c5"><span class="c2"></span></p>
<p class="c9"><span class="c2">Our group has the required skill sets and applied experience to implement this type of web-based video conferencing app by using high-level javascript APIs and existing open-source resources. 2 group members are familiar web developers and the third specializes in UX design for tech companies.</span></p>
<p class="c5"><span class="c2"></span></p>
<p class="c9"><span class="c2">We estimate that the work will take us a total of roughly 10 weeks to implement by splitting the project into 3 phases of implementation. Firstly, we expect to spend 1-2 weeks seeking, familiarizing and adapting an open-source/sample video-conferencing app to suit our needs. Then we expect to use 3-4 weeks to build the whisper functionality &amp; baseline user experience. Followed by another 3-4 weeks testing, iterating and finalizing the user-experience and aesthetics of the system.</span></p>
